# ChatBots
You will need to have `.env` file that will contain your API keys (GROQ, OpenAI, etc.) that will be referenced in your `app.py` files. All of these Chatbots us GROQ API for their tasks. It is pretty easy task to integrate GROQ and use it for our applications. All you need to do is to change the prompt and you're good to go.

- `app.py`: This was my first foray into the field of LLMs and API usage. It's a simple app that use the GROQ API to answer some basic questions.

- `HeartHelper`: This was a fun idea I had, like how would AI help with Dating and Relationships. And this is just between you and me, they are not that bad at it. I gave this to my friends who are in relationships and asked them to follow the advice that it gave and looks like all of them had pretty good experience with the HeartHelper.

- `TaleSpark`: A versatile story generator that will generate amazing stories and scripts based on the users needs.

- `LinguaVox`: A simple real-time langauge translation application. The user has to select the source langauge, target language, and give it the text that they want to translate and it will give the translated text.
